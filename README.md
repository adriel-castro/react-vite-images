# README

This repository contains a React application powered by Vite. Below are the steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, run the application, and run tests on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, open your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adriel-castro/react-vite-images.git
```

## Installing Dependencies

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory using the terminal:

```sh
cd your-repository
```

Then, install the project dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

This command will install all the required packages and dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Application

After the installation is complete, you can start the Vite development server by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command will compile the React code and start a local development server. Once the compilation is finished, you can access the application by typing `http://localhost:5173` in your browser's address bar.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```sh
npm run test
```

This command will execute the test cases defined in your project.

Alternatively, to run the UI tests, use:

```sh
npm run test:ui
```

This command will execute the test cases defined in your project. Ensure that you have appropriate test scripts set up in your project configuration.

## Stopping the Application

To stop the development server, you can press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running. It will prompt you to confirm if you want to terminate the process. Type `Y` and press `Enter` to stop the server.
